# Sim 5 
# Food gradient performance test
# Constantly create lots of food, remove lots of food (maybe even randomly)
# Perhaps add a timing mechanism to measure performance

# Change the idea of food to objects
# the "food map" will be updated on every tick based on its Environment's "collection" of # food objects
